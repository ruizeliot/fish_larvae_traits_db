# Dispersive Traits Database

A total of 7 categorical variables and 28 numerical variables constitute the core of our dispersive traits database, which is segmented into 17 different databases, each dedicated to a specific trait or data type. We adopted a standardized way to provide all statistical descriptors of numeric variables in separate columns identified by specific suffixes in their names: mean (`_MEAN`), minimum (`_MIN`), maximum (`_MAX`), variability (`_CONF`), mean type (`_MEAN_TYPE`), range type (`_RANGE_TYPE`) and variability type (`_CONF_TYPE`). These columns are complemented by 57 metadata types relevant for interpreting each dispersive trait (e.g., origin, temperature, sample size, variable type, definitions). The number of metadata fields varies between databases, ranging from 2 (rafting) to 17 (settlement size), with an average of 8. Missing data also varies widely across databases (mean percentage of NA ranging from 5.5% to 83.3%, average 50.2%).



## General columns
Description of columns systematically present in all databases, providing the taxonomy and references for each record, along with easy access to the source using the URL/DOI. The valid name (and associated taxonomic information) can be used as the backbone for linking records across all other databases, but this should not be done using the original name that might vary among references for a single species.

## Metamorphosis age/duration database
This species-level database documents the timing and duration of metamorphosis, which is the transition from larval to juvenile stage. This process largely varies among fish families, but is often characterized by the appearance of scales, the growth of all fin spines/rays to reach the adult count, the acquisition of juvenile coloration, and/or the loss of specialized larval attributes (criteria used by authors were sometimes reported in `MET_DEFINITION`.

## Age at settlement database
This species-level database records the age at settlement for benthic/demersal fishes, as it is the transition from a pelagic to a benthic lifestyle. Several other metadata column provide insight into the sampling process, the settlement size, and the methodology used to characterize age along with temperature.

## Pelagic juvenile stage database
This species-level database documents the possibility to extend the pelagic phase duration after the larval phase of benthic/demersal fishes. It also records the size and age of wild individuals sampled to determine this trait, along with the keyword used by authors to designate this stage.

## Known rafting behaviour database
This species or genus-level database records observations of fishes associated with floating objects or organisms in the pelagic environment, which could largely increase their dispersal potential. It includes details about the floatsam type and the size/age of rafting individuals.

## Critical swimming speed database
This species-level database records critical swimming speed (Ucrit) at or near the settlement stage of benthic/demersal fishes. Ucrit corresponds to laboratory measurements of short-term maximum speed in a swimming flume. Both absolute (cm per second) and relative (body length per second) swimming speeds are provided, the latter having been computed from the size of tested individuals

## In situ swimming speed database
This species-level database records In Situ Swimming speed (ISS) at or near the settlement stage of benthic/demersal fishes. ISS corresponds to in situ measurements while diving of routine speed in the pelagic environment. Both absolute (cm per second) and relative (body length per second) swimming speeds are provided, the latter having been computed from the size of tested individuals
